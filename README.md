This repository contains the complete source code for Adam's Personal Portfolio Website. Conceived and executed as a comprehensive digital resume, the primary objective of this project is to create an engaging, highly navigable platform that effectively articulates the developer's professional identity, technical proficiencies, and project history. The site moves beyond the limitations of a static document by showcasing functional examples of Adam's work. The core goals include establishing a clean, modern online presence, clearly segmenting skills (Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Problem Solving), and ensuring excellent accessibility and usability across all devices. The functional features include structured navigation and highly responsive design built upon modern CSS methodologies.

To examine and test the project files on your local machine, the following steps must be followed. Since this is a static project, the setup process is minimal, but utilizing a local server is strongly recommended for accurate testing of file paths and scripts. Prerequisites include having Git installed, a modern web browser, and a code editor. Begin by cloning the repository using git clone [REPOSITORY_URL_HERE] and then changing into the project directory.

The most reliable way to run and test the website locally is by serving the files via a simple HTTP server to prevent browser security errors (CORS issues). The recommended method is using the VS Code Live Server Extension (by Ritwick Dey), where you simply right-click the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server." Alternatively, you can use Python's Simple HTTP Server by navigating to the project root in your terminal and running python3 -m http.server 8000, then navigating your browser to http://localhost:8000. If neither server option is available, you can attempt the direct method by double-clicking the index.html file, though this may impact some functionality.

Finally, a few development notes are provided. This portfolio is successfully deployed on a modern static hosting platform (e.g., Vercel), leveraging their global CDN. The primary tech stack is intentionally lean, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate fundamental proficiency. All code adheres to best practices for readability and maintainability. Adam extends his gratitude to the various online tutorials, documentation (MDN, W3Schools), and open-source communities that provided resources and guidance throughout the project's development.
